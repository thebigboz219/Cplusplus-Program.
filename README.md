# Cplusplus-Program.

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project we were given the task of creating a banking program that calculated how much your investment would grow if you did monthly deposits at a certain interest rate. The calculations for this growth were simple to do, but the true challenge was formatting and error checking all inputs. Figuring out how to error check and correct if users entered a "foreign" character into a certain input request.

# What did you do particularly well?
After doing some research on error checking I found the ideal way to make sure users entered the correct kind of input. Along with the error checking the menu selection is made so that it can only accept teh correct inputs, or it defaults to an error message.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Outside of maybe better phrasing and coding format, I'm a little unsure where I could make the most improvements. I do feel like I could have made the output display look a little better for the user.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are       you adding to your support network?
The most challenging pieces of code were the error checking for all the user inputs. I spend a few hours seraching C++ forums and code reference sites. These were excellent resources, since they showed different varients of code and how to properly utilize it.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to calculate interest and properly recieve and check input from users will be very useful throughout my schooling in coding. Without error checking my code would crash everytime a user entered anything besides what was requested.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make the program readable each section of code is seperated by function so that anyone going through and reading it can see what each section does and where it ends. The program can be very easily adapted, since each function and seperate and kept as much out of main as possible so that changes can be made incase of a different desire for the code.
